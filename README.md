<h1>L2FL3</h1>
The project that aims to add any missing files from LWJGL 2 to LWJGL 3.

L2FL3, short for "LWJGL 2 for LWJGL 3" is a Java Library used to integrate classes that LWJGL 3 does not.
People who like the way LWJGL 2 worked instead of the GLFW LWJGL 3 stuff, will like this library.
It brings back GLU, Display, Keyboard, Mouse, Sys, and more.

The library is written in LWJGL 3.3.3+5 and is recommended to use this version or above.
